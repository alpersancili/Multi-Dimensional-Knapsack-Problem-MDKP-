# Multi-Dimensional-Knapsack-Problem-MDKP-
This repository presents a Python implementation of the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming. The code is designed to solve the problem efficiently for scenarios where items have weights in multiple dimensions, and the goal is to maximize the total value of the selected items without exceeding the capacities in any dimension
